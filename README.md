Simple project 1 : Develop a todo list on dotnet window form app

Learn and develop an app on .NET. <br>

Workflow:
From the video, Shaun shares the tutorial on how to code a todo list in C#. 
He added 2 textboxs for user inputs, 4 types of buttons for the app actions and data grid view for the app output.
Data sources are based on the user inputs from the fields. 

App has 4 features which are New, Edit, Delete and Save.

For this personal project, I added another 3 new features to improve user experiences and there are task due date, complete checkbox and urgent checkbox. 

The outcome that I have learned by developing this app is to understand the concept of input stores in the system and display the output according to its data type.
Thank you for the ChatGPT where I used it as part of my learning process in getting detail explainations of C# concepts.
